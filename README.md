# Stock Price Forecasting with Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Overview

This project predicts future stock prices using historical data and machine learning models (ARIMA, LSTM, GRU, Transformers). An interactive dashboard visualizes predictions and trends.

## Features

- Collect historical stock prices via Yahoo Finance API
- Perform exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
- Implement baseline (ARIMA) and advanced deep learning models (LSTM/GRU)
- Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Optional: Incorporate sentiment analysis for improved predictions

## Installation
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-forecasting.git 
```
```bash
cd stock-price-forecasting
```
```bash
python -m venv env
```
```bash
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
```
```bash
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Run Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ for exploration and modeling

- Start the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

## Skills Learned

- Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch

- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

- Streamlit / Dashboard Deployment

- Docker & Cloud Deployment (optional)
